#Cartos

A web-application to create data-visualizations on an SVG map of India both
programmatically and manually.

## The map

The map is essentially an SVG image which needs to be loaded onto an HTML 
app. At the moment, only a few states have been outlined. For the proof of
concept, we needn't add any more states.

For referring to states, use this [reference][1].

## The application

The application will be a simple HTML file with associated javascript programs
and stylesheets. For deployment, we will use gh-pages. Once we are comfortable
with a release, we will merge the master branch onto gh-pages and that shall 
serve as our 'prod' server.

## Vendor libraries

I am open to use any library. I haven't yet tried out backbone.js and would like
to try that out, but if you have better suggestions, keep them coming.
